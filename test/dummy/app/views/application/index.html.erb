<p>Render an avatar:</p>
<%= render AvatarComponent.new(initials: "V C") %>
<br>
<% component = AvatarComponent.new(initials: "V C", html_options: {class: "bg-red-500"}) %>
<p>The following example sets a background color override using a tailwind utility class (note that sometimes you will
  find overrides don't work due to CSS specificity. To solve this use the `vident-tailwind` module in your component!)</p>
<%= render component %>
<br>
<p>Components can also have a `#cache_key` method which plays nicely with fragment caching.</p>
<p>Cache Key for above component: <%= component.cache_key %></p>

<p>Cache Key for Avatar component with different attributes: <%= AvatarComponent.new(initials: "V C").cache_key %></p>
